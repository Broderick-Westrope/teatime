# Tea Time

I want to create a TUI messaging application using Golang and Bubble Tea. It will have a client-server architecture, make use of WebSockets, and persist state.  Eventually, it will leverage the Signal protocol, and have typing indicators and read receipts, but I want to start simple and add these features incrementally.
